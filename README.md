**SlotPlanner** is a local desktop application for intelligent weekly time slot planning using constraint optimization.  
It is designed to assign children to available teachers or therapists based on preferences, availability, tandem rules, and other constraints.

---

## Functional Requirements

### 1. **Time Model**

* The planning is weekly (Monday‚ÄìFriday).
* Slots are 45 minutes long, with 15-minute raster start times (e.g., 08:00, 08:15, ‚Ä¶).
* The schedule structure is identical each week.

---

### 2. **Teachers**

* Each teacher has fixed weekly availability (per weekday and start time).
* A teacher can supervise:

  * One child per time slot, or
  * Two children **if they form a tandem**.
* **Soft constraint:** Teachers should preferably have a 15-minute break between slots.

---

### 3. **Children**

* Each child has weekly availability (same structure as teachers).
* Each child:

  * Can specify preferred teachers,
  * May be marked as **early-preferred** (should be scheduled earlier in the day),
  * Must be assigned **exactly one 45-minute slot per week**.

---

### 4. **Tandems**

* A tandem is a pair of children who should, if possible, be scheduled **together** in the same time slot with the same teacher.
* If a tandem is successfully scheduled, the teacher can supervise both at once.

---

### 5. **Optimization Goals**

All planning is optimized with the following soft objectives:

* Assign children to preferred teachers.
* Schedule early-preferred children earlier in the day.
* Schedule tandems together if possible.
* Minimize back-to-back appointments for teachers (encourage breaks).
* **Minimize changes** between previous and updated schedules when re-planning (stability preference).

All goals are weighted and configurable.

---

### 6. **Weight Configuration (User-Defined)**

Users can define how important each goal is:

```toml
preferred_teacher = 5
priority_early_slot = 3
tandem_fulfilled = 4
teacher_pause_respected = 1
preserve_existing_plan = 10
```

---

### 7. **Application Functionality**

* GUI-based desktop application (PySide6/Qt)
* Fully operable without command-line interaction
* Cross-platform executables: Windows `.exe`, macOS `.app`, Linux AppImage
* No external Python installation needed for users
* Data is stored per school year as JSON (`data/YYYY_YYYY.json`)
* Supports:

  * Adding/editing teachers, children, tandems
  * Adjusting weights
  * Creating and updating schedules
  * Loading previous years‚Äô plans for re-planning

---

### 8. **Output**

* **Per-teacher weekly plan** with time slots and assigned children/tandems
* Export as **printable PDF**
* Includes a **violation summary** (e.g. unmet preferences, late assignment, broken tandems)

---

### 9. **Result Structure**

The solution output includes:

* Teacher-to-slot assignment
* Per-child assignment + fulfilled preferences
* List of violations (e.g. "K1 not assigned to preferred teacher")
* Optimization config used
* (Optionally) reference to a previous plan for change minimization

---

### 10. **Progress Feedback**

* During solving, the app displays a progress indicator.
* After solving:

  * Shows status: **Optimal**, **Feasible**, or **No solution**
  * Displays solution runtime (e.g. ‚ÄúSolved in 42 seconds‚Äù)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Weights

Optimization weights are fully configurable in the GUI settings:

- **Teacher Preference Weight**: Prioritize assigning children to preferred teachers
- **Early Time Weight**: Schedule children earlier in the day when preferred
- **Tandem Fulfillment Weight**: Maximize successful tandem scheduling
- **Stability Weight**: Minimize changes from previous schedules

All weights range from 0.0 to 1.0 and are adjustable through the application interface.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Structure

All data is stored per school year in:

```
/data/YYYY_YYYY.json
```

Structure includes:

* Teachers (name, availability)
* Children (availability, preferences, priority)
* Tandems (pairs of children)
* Config weights
* Planning result + violations
